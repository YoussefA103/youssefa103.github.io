**Realising Opportunities Programme at UCL**

The Realising Opportunities programme at UCL has augmented my referencing and note-taking abilities, making me increasingly aware of where plagiarism may occur while refining my independence and disposition to meet academic expectations.



**Lectures**

**LSE Economics and Economic History Lecture Taster Course**

Attending Professor Oliver Volckart's 'Raising revenues: The short term versus the long term in premodern monetary policies' lecture at LSE informed me about the significance of currency, in pre-modern history, in expediting trade and the implications of coinage debasing, to amplify rulers' seigniorage, on economies in the form of inflation derived from expanding money supply. This prompted me to investigate the significance of currency and monetary policy in my investigation of Italy’s economic history.

**UCL Economics, Mathematics, and Statistics Masterclasses**

Primarily, attending UCL’s Mathematics and Statistics masterclasses reinforced my knowledge of various mathematical techniques, such as the bisection method and fixed-point iteration to solve root-finding problems. In addition, UCL’s Economics Masterclass supplemented my knowledge around global inequality and economic divergence between nations overtime.



**Books and Reading**

**The Rise and Fall of the Italian Economy by Carlo Bastasin and Gianni Toniolo**

My investigation of Italy's economic history and monetary management in relation to its economic stagnation relative to other potent Western European nations, propelled me to read 'The Rise and Fall of The Italian Economy' by Carlo Bastasin and Gianni Toniolo. Particularly, the chapter 'The Lost Opportunity' augmented my knowledge of Italy's frequent and unsustainable lira devaluations in pursuit of greater international competitiveness while potential stagflation, which the cessation of the 'scala mobile', or automatic wage indexation attempted to counter, made apparent to me that unintended consequences of policy intervention may inadvertently exacerbate nations' lack of competitiveness; especially in light of intra-continental economic context, such as the emergence of Eastern Europe as safe havens for Italy's malign capital flight. This disciplined me with the significance and delicacy of monetary policy decisions, as well as the lasting consequences of inadequate fiscal policy, further accentuated by Bastasin and Toniolo's emphasis on Italy's fatal abandonment of public-debt reducing policies as well as its underestimation of the eurozone's stable monetary framework that societal and economic reforms would have unlocked upon access to the euro, exposing a fragile italian economy to recessions and financial crises.

**KPMG Work Placement**

Initially, I explored the SME schemes claimable by firms with eligible expenditure, parameters and determinants assessed to grant firms a reduction in costs through evaluations of whether such expenditures directly or indirectly contribute to the scientific and technological advancements explored. Furthermore, I shadowed a KPMG professional during a video call meeting with the client firm discussing possible government-subsidising figures in the event of an accepted claim by HMRC. This provided me with an Insight in the Tax and Legal sector's role within the firm as well as the interaction and communication with clients. Additionally, I shadowed professionals in a meeting between senior members and departments discussing key business objectives, strategies and contemporary performance. Moreover, I was assigned with the task of producing spreadsheets of potentially qualifying expenditure of a client firm through a Research and Development scheme along with a cleansed R&D assessment utilised to derive the total qualifying expenditure, comprising net RDEC rates. Finally, I summarised key project bottlenecks and difficulties experienced by the clients in their research to provide a scientific or technological advancement through specific confidential scenarios encountered.


**PwC Temporary Contracted Employment ('New World. New Skills')**

I refined my analytical skills and was presented with a practical application of mathematics at my contracted temporary employment at PwC's 'New World. New Skills' work placement, in the Tax Team, where I was tasked with verifying invoices and composing VAT return proformas.

**Barclays Life Skills Work Experience**
I produced a project exploring possible services Barclays could offer to become more inclusive: an improvement in accessibility needs when logging into online or mobile banking, while mainly targeting visually impaired individuals. Furthermore, I developed this idea through more intensive research. This has prompted me to develop key skills in researching, identifying key data, statistics and relevant information. Consequently, this led to my improvement in referencing significant data to prove the predicted effectiveness of my project and its need for Barclays to become a more inclusive bank.



**Extracurriculars**

**UKMT Society**

I am a founder of a mathematics society at Walthamstow Academy targeting Year 7 and 8 students to provide guidance on what they should expect in their UKMT exams as well as additional teaching and practice to maximise their possibility to get a GOLD tier UKMT certificate and be amongst the top Mathematics students in the country. Support is provided at a regular basis weekly through mentoring, teaching and question practice to assure students feel confident when approaching this competition to exhibit their problem-solving aptitude,

Running this club involves group work, communication and coordination between me and my peers to make decisions on what practice papers would be the best and most effective to target growth in students.


**Buddy Reading**

I supported the academic growth and improvement of Year 7 and 8 students who struggled more than others on aspects such a literacy and reading. I assisted the reading of students to help them acknowledge the sounds and pronunciations that should be used in specific words, while providing definitions and examples to broaden their knowledge. This has reinforced my skills in communication and prioritisation.
I am now more aware of my flexibility and commitment as I was available to assist any student at any time, and am consistently open to being called upon for times earlier than usual to assist students with their literacy.
